## 📊 Reading Your Stats

### Score Card (Top)
- **Big Number**: Your current score
- **Below it**: To par (E, +5, -2, etc.)
- **Bottom**: Total par and holes played

### Three Big Cards
**Note**: All UI elements use the five-color design system:
- `#0a140a` - Dark background
- `#DDEDD2` - Light green (borders, buttons, text)
- `#F2D1A4` - Brown accent
- `#D4A574` - Gold (metric accents)
- `#FFF8E7` - Cream (metric highlights)

1. **GIR %** 
   - Uses light green (`#DDEDD2`) for display
   - Target: >55% (good!)
   
2. **Fairway %**
   - Uses light green (`#DDEDD2`) for display
   - Excludes par 3s automatically
   
3. **Putts Average**
   - Uses light green (`#DDEDD2`) for display
   - Target: ~2.0 per hole

### Additional Stats
- **Scrambling**: Up & downs / Missed GIRs
- **3-Putts**: Count (want this at 0!)
- **Sand Saves**: Count
- **Penalties**: Count (avoid these!)

### Front/Back 9 (After hole 10)
Shows separate scoring for each nine

### 💡 Smart Analysis
Orange box with:
- **Main Issue**: What's costing you the most strokes
- **Specific Advice**: What to practice

---

## 🎯 Understanding the Analysis

### Example Analysis:
```
💡 Three-putts cost you 3 strokes

You 3-putted 3 times. Practice lag putting from 30-40 feet. 
Focus on getting within tap-in range.
```

**What it means**: If you eliminate those 3-putts, you'd save 3 strokes!

### Priority Order:
1. **Penalties** - Biggest score killers
2. **3-Putts** - Easiest to fix
3. **Scrambling** - Short game crucial
4. **Missed GIRs** - Approach shots
5. **Missed Fairways** - Driving

## 🎓 Golf Stat Education

### What is GIR?
**Greens in Regulation**: Reaching the green in par minus 2 strokes
- Par 3: On in 1 shot
- Par 4: On in 2 shots
- Par 5: On in 3 shots

**Why it matters**: GIR is the #1 predictor of low scores

### What is Scrambling?
**Scrambling %**: (Up & Downs / Missed GIRs) × 100

When you miss the green, do you still save par?
- **Tour Pros**: ~60%
- **Scratch golfer**: ~40-50%
- **Average**: ~20-30%

### What's a Good Scrambling %?
- **30%+**: Good
- **40%+**: Very good
- **50%+**: Excellent

### Fairway Stats
**Why track fairways?**
- Hitting fairway = easier approach
- Missing fairway = harder to hit GIR
- Fairways setup birdies

**Tour average**: ~60% fairways

---

## 🔥 Pro Tips

### Fastest Data Entry:
1. Know your putts/score before opening app
2. Enter data while walking to next tee
3. Skip optional fields if pressed for time
4. Use voice assistant to count putts

### Pattern Recognition:
After 9 holes, check:
- Are you always missing greens short/long?
- Always missing fairways left/right?
- More 3-putts on long putts?

**These patterns = practice targets!**

### Practice Based on Data:
If app says "Poor scrambling cost you 3 strokes":
- Spend next range session on chipping
- Practice from 5-15 yards around green
- Work on different lies (rough, fringe, sand)
